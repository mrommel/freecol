                            <p align="justify">Git is the tool we use for storing our source code in a&nbsp;<a
                                    href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/git/" title="repo">central
                                location</a>. This system allows everyone to have their own copy of the source code.
                                You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">read more about Git</a> at
                                Wikipedia. <br/><br/> If you just wish to take a quick look at the the code, you may use
                                the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/git/">web-based interface</a>.

                            <h4>Development branches</h4>
                            <p align="justify">We are sometimes developing two versions of FreeCol at the same time: the
                                master version and a stable branch. The former will contain the in development version and
                                will probably be buggy for some time, while the latter is only updated when creating stable
                                releases and rarely when preparing bugfixes for next stable release.
                                Usually, only the master branch is being worked on though.</p>
                            <h4>Download and Build</h4>
                            <p align="justify">There are several ways to download a git repository for FreeCol available
                                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/git/">here</a> and at the occasionally updated
                                <a href="https://github.com/FreeCol/freecol">mirror</a>. In order to compile the game
                                you will need a <strong>Java Virtual Machine version 1.8 or higher</strong> and a recent
                                version of <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a>.</p>
