                            <h4>How to update a bug tracker item while you are working on it</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Assign yourself to the tracker item before you start working on it.</li>
                                <li>Please verify that no duplicate entry has been posted. If you can find a duplicate:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If the bug has NOT been fixed, please use the resolution "Duplicate", set the status to "Closed" and post a comment with the ID of the other tracker item (add a comment to the other tracker item as well).</li>
                                        <li>If the bug has been fixed, use the resolution "Out of date" and close the tracker item.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Set the item's status to pending if you require input from the person originally submitting the item.</li>
                                <li>If you are unable to complete the item: Assign it to "None" and make a comment describing any problems relevant for another developer.</li>
                                <li>
                                    After you have completed the work: Set the group to "Fixed (trunk)", resolution to "Fixed" and the status to "Closed". Please also write a comment telling that the work is done.<br/>
                                    If the bug is fixed in a branch, you should set the group to fixed for that branch, but it must be fixed in trunk too.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>You can use any suitable canned response instead of writing a comment. For example: You can use the "Fixed: Use Subversion" after you have fixed a bug.</p>
