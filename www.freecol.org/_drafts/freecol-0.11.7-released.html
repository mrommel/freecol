                                FreeCol 0.11.7 has been released.
                                All 0.10.x and 0.11.x games should continue
                                to work with 0.11.6, with the exception of
                                games generated with 0.11.4 which are badly
                                broken. For more details on the changes
                                since 0.11.6, see the
                                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/wiki/0.11.7%20Release%20Notes/"
