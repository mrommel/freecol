                            Q. When is the next release coming out?<br /><br />
                            A. This question is discussed on the freecol-developers mailing list.&nbsp; Anyone who wants a detailed understanding of the current issues in FreeCol is more than welcome to subscribe (see <a href="community.html" title="here">/community.html)</a>. The list is low volume, and nicely illustrates that the real answer to this question is almost always `No one knows&#39;.<br /><br />
                            Q. No, really, surely you have some sort of plan/roadmap/release schedule?<br /><br />
                            A. Not really.  FreeCol is developed for fun, by a small group of volunteer contributors, at least some of which find the idea of a formal release schedule in a small volunteer project laughably impractical and/or not fun.<br /><br />
                            Q. Well, alright, can you at least tell us what will be in the next release?<br /><br />
