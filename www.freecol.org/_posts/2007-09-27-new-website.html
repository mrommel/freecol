This site is hopefully both better looking and easier to maintain than our old site. You can now participate in the development of the website, for example by adding more documentation.

    <img src="/images/old-site.jpg" align="left" style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-right: 10px;" alt="" />The design of the old site has almost been untouched since 2002. New content was frequently added, but this is the first time we make larger changes to the appearance. People missing the old site can state their unhappiness using the poll on the <a href="community.html">Community</a> page. I hope you will eventually enjoy the new site :-)
