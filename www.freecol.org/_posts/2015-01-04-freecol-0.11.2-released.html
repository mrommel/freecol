    The FreeCol team are mostly pleased to announce the release of FreeCol 0.11.2.
    This is a bug fix release to clean up yet more annoying problems in version 0.11.0/1.
    See the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/wiki/0.11.2%20Release%20Notes/" title="release notes">release notes</a> for more detail.
    All 0.10.x and 0.11.x games should continue to work with 0.11.2.<br />
