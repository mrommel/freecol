  FreeCol 0.10.7 has been released.&nbsp; This is a bug fix release to correct some serious gameplay problems in 0.10.6.&nbsp; The only new<br />
  feature present is some improvements to the graphics.<br /><br />
  Since FreeCol 0.10.6 was released there have been 18 new bug reports, of which 8 are fixed in 0.10.7, one (roads are sometimes ignored) is partially fixed, 4 were invalid, 3 can not be reproduced or are otherwise awaiting clarification, one was a duplicate and one was a content contribution.&nbsp; Two other pre-0.10.6 bug reports were also fixed.&nbsp; Bug reports remain crucial to improving FreeCol.&nbsp; When reporting please try think about what the developers would need to reproduce the bug.&nbsp; Very few bugs are easily reproducible from just a textural description.&nbsp; Too many bug reports get stalled, sometimes indefinitely, because of a missing log file (which is almost always needed in the case of a crash or hang) or missing saved game (almost always needed to replay some sort of strange behaviour).<br /><br />
  Note also, we do not handle translation directly.&nbsp; FreeCol is translated by the volunteers at https://translatewiki.net/.&nbsp; Please<br />
  raise translation issues there, except in cases where you see messages containing percent-delimited words %like% %this%.&nbsp; These are coding bugs and belong on the bug tracker.<br /><br />
  There were also several other bugs fixed, including one that can result in certain bonuses (e.g. Jefferson, Newspaper) being counted<br />
  twice.&nbsp; This can lead to very enjoyable levels of bell production.&nbsp; New games should not have this problem, but existing saved games are vulnerable.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a fully backward compatible fix would be quite complex and thus likely to cause worse problems and delay this release, so please do not report this as a bug.&nbsp; Such reports will be closed with a `Wont Fix&#39; status.<br /><br />
  There are also lurking problems with old saved games using the America_large map, due to some lake tiles with null regions and single isolated river tiles.&nbsp; The map has been fixed so new games are safe.&nbsp; These problems have caused crashes, all reported cases of which are fixed, but we are not that confident there are no more.<br /><br />
  Finally, there are still various hard to reproduce problems where the active unit is not correctly displayed.&nbsp; These tend to depend strongly on what happened just before.&nbsp; If you wish to report one of these bugs, we will need a saved game, and instructions on what to do to make the problem happen.&nbsp; A saved game in the failed state will not be enough.
