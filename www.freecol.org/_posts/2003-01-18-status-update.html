The FreeCol project is currently in need of graphics for
things such as cities (colonies),
goods, 16th/17th century artwork (drawings of people for
example), icons/buttons, ... If
you are a graphical artist then you can be of great help to the
project.<br /><br />
We have managed to port the server to Java. As a result, the
development version of FreeCol is now entirely
written in Java. This version can be found in CVS.
