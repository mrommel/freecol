We have prepared a release candidate for FreeCol 0.4.0. This pre-release contains all of the major features intended for the official release, but is not expected to be completely stable. Please report any bugs you might encounter, in order to help us make the official release more stable.

Changes from version 0.3.0:
- Compatability with J2SE 5.0
- AI for indian players
- Visiting indian villages (colonist, missionary and scout)
- Trade with indians.
- Graphical updates and Colonizopedia framework
- Tons of bugfixes
