Lars Willemsens, the first leader of our development team, has now left the
project. He did a great job at managing the project and was also the lead
programmer in the first two years. Thank you for your work on our
promising little project. :-)
<br /><br />
The continuation of development is assured by both old and new developers,
some of which have joined in the past few months.
