    FreeCol 0.11.6 has been released.
    All 0.10.x and 0.11.x games should continue
    to work with 0.11.6, with the exception of
    games generated with 0.11.4 which are badly
    broken. For more details on the changes
    since 0.11.5, see the
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/wiki/0.11.6%20Release%20Notes/" title="release notes">release notes</a>.
