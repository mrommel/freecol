                            Check out the <a class="cLink"
                                             href="../screenshots.html">Screenshots</a> section for 2 more screenshots of
                            the Java client.<br />
                            Ships can now carry units and units will automatically
                            disembark when the user moves a ship into land. The states of
                            the units are now also visible on the map. What you
                            can't see from these screenshots is that all possible forms of scrolling
                            and
                            automatically recentering of the view have been
                            implemented.
