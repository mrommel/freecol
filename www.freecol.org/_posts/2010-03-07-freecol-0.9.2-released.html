<div align="left">FreeCol 0.9.2 has been released. </div>

<div align="left">This is a bug/feature-fix release, the main changes being:<br />
  <ul>
    <li>The increased native land claims in 0.9.1 have been reverted to the more moderate 0.9.0 behaviour, following comment that this made the game too difficult.&nbsp; This feature will be back in a later release, but only after implementing the feature that at least exempts your <em>first </em>colony from having to buy its land (as was the case with the original Colonization).</li>
    <li>Fixed a serious bug in privateer combat.</li>
  </ul>
  No new features were introduced with this release, and saved games from previous 0.9.x versions should remain compatible.&nbsp; We hope this release will provide a stable, playable and enjoyable version of FreeCol. <br />
