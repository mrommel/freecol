<div align="left">After several weeks of bug-fixing, we are proud to announce FreeCol-0.9.0-alpha2, the second pre-release of FreeCol 0.9.0.<br /></div>

<p align="left">This is expected to be the last pre-release on our way to 0.9.0, which we hope to release before the end of the year. Several features were improved, but no new features were added for this release.</p>
