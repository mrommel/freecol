SourceForge.net is currently accepting nominations for their annual <a href="http://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/" class="cLink">Community Choice Awards</a>. If you would like to see FreeCol among this year's winners, you should nominate the project now and vote for it later. Naturally, development will continue as usual, whether we win anything or not, but the additional "publicity" might well attract further developers eager to improve the FreeCol experience. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/nomination.php?group_id=43225&amp;from=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Ffreecol" class="cLink">Nominate FreeCol</a>
