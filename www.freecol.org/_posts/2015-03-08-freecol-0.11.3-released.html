    The FreeCol team are vaguely pleased to announce the release of
    FreeCol 0.11.3. This is a bug fix release to clean up yet more annoying
    problems in version 0.11.0/1/2. See the
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/wiki/0.11.3%20Release%20Notes/" title="release notes">release notes</a> for more detail.
    All 0.10.x and 0.11.x games should continue to work with 0.11.3.<br />

    We hope you enjoy FreeCol 0.11.3.&nbsp; Onward to 1.0.<br /><br />
