    FreeCol Nightly Releases are ready!

    Download an installer here:

    Please let us know if it works or does not work. This is experimental and I'm running on Mac, so have only tested the Mac installer thus far.

    If you find bugs or annoyances, please report them to our bug tracker:

  <h4>Nitty Gritty Technobabble stuff:</h4>

    Nightly releases are initiated automatically whenever a merge is performed to the "slim" branch on Github. I'll change this later to a "prerelease" branch once we confirm everything works.
    <br/>
    The slim branch excludes srcdata and the website, so clones work much faster on this branch. I'll probably change the initiation of a nightly release cron to run once a day only if there are new commits, so that merges can be performed multiple times a day without triggering a release every time.
