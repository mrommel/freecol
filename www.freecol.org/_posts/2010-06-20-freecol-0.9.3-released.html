<div align="left">
  We have just released FreeCol 0.9.3. This release fixes several bugs,<br />
  including a combat bug that made it possible to capture colonies that<br />
  still had armed defenders. The handling of keyboard accelerators was<br />
  improved in several ways. Keyboard accelerators are now available for<br />
  virtually all mapboard actions, including movement, a feature that was<br />
  requested by several users who use keyboards without a key pad. And<br />
  keyboard accelerators are now (optionally) localized.<br /><br />
  FreeCol has had the ability to include graphical &quot;mods&quot; (bundles of<br />
  images that replace standard images) for some time now. But FreeCol<br />
  0.9.3 is the first release that actually includes such a mod, a bundle<br />
  of images for goods, ships and native settlements by &quot;hutzli&quot;. Please<br />
  note that you will have to restart FreeCol after selecting a mod<br />
  before the setting becomes active.<br /><br />
