This latest release of FreeCol is focused mainly on the improvement of the artificial intelligence and on the addition of new features that allow the player to interact with the natives.<br />
On top of that we've made the game compatible with J2SE 5.0, we did some cosmetic updates and fixed a lot of bugs.
<br /><br />
Changes from version 0.4.0-pre are mostly cosmetic updates and bugfixes.
