<p>We have received news that a commercial Colonization clone is in production. This news was made available Wednesday in a <a href="http://ir.take2games.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=315205">press release</a> from 2K Games/Firaxis. </p>
<p>The game will be made available in fall 2008. It will be marketed under the title <strong>Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization</strong> but will nevertheless be a standalone game. Hopefully this is for marketing purposes and not an indication of any missing features/shortcuts. We wait in anticipation for a sequel to the original Colonization that was released 14 years ago. </p>
<p>Rest assured that our team will continue working on FreeCol no matter how good or bad the remake turns out. </p>
